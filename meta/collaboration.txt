# Lines that start with "#" are comments, following the Unix convention
# Indicate your collaborators in this file. 
# If you collaborate with multiple people on a lab, make a new line
# in this file for each lab/role/person combination.
# A data line has three words, of the form:
# labX role userid
# Possible values for role are: mentor, protege, partner, converser
# "Converser" is a noun that means a person you talk with.
# There is no mark cap for having conversations [see course outline].
# Write the userid "nobody" if you did not speak with anyone.
# If you have multiple collaborators for a given lab, use multiple lines
# You should have at least one line for each lab.
